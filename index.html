    <h3>How the app logic works</h3>

    <h4>
        <p>1. We have created the fibbonaci nth calculator logic</p>
        <p>2. We have implemented the DOM functions and we have added a event for the
            button click which gets the value from the input field and places it into
            fibonacci function. Then this is rendered to the DOM if the value from the
            input field is in the range implemented in the if statement</p>
        <p>3. We have implemented the DOM functions and we have added a event for the
                enter event which gets the value from the input field and places it into
                fibonacci function. Then this is rendered to the DOM if the value from the
                input field is in the range implemented in the if statement</p>
